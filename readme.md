# Zerodha Trading Strategies and Backtesting

## About the Project
This repository is a collection of Python-based trading strategies and backtesting programs, developed as part of my Computer Science Engineering (CSE) tenure at UIET Kurukshetra University in 2018. The project focuses on automated and manual live trading on the NSE-BSE markets using Zerodha's API. It incorporates Artificial Intelligence techniques to execute trades based on various technical indicators.

The repository consists of:
- **Live trading bots**
- **Backtesting programs**
- **Stock screeners**
- **Technical indicator implementations**
- **Historical data downloaders**

## Features
- **Live Trading Bots:** Automated and manual trading bots utilizing technical strategies.
- **Backtesting Programs:** Test trading strategies on historical data.
- **Stock Screener:** Scans stocks based on Guppy and other technical indicators.
- **Technical Indicators:** Implementation of popular stock market indicators.
- **Data Conversion:** Converts candlestick data to Heikin-Ashi format.
- **Time Frame Adjustments:** Custom time frame modifications for analysis.
